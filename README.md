# Beamer Snippets

Formatting Beamer presentations with TikZ is difficult and time consuming,
but well worth the effort.
I often refer back to previous presentations to reuse page layouts
and TikZ diagram formats.
This repository archives these snippets and makes them easy to
browse and copy/paste by using Python to generate static HTML pages
to be hosted by GitHub Pages.
This repository also contains my LaTeX preamble for Beamer presentations.

## Why not <other LaTeX examples site>?
TODO has an excellent collection of TikZ diagrams and templates
and has largely inspired this repository.
I'm using this for a more specific instance with a shared
preamble and only for Beamer/TikZ presentations,
which TODO doesn't have.
